# Chen System Simulation

## Overview
This project explores the simulation of the Chen chaotic system using MATLAB. The Chen system is a three-dimensional chaotic dynamical system with applications in chaos theory, secure communications, and cryptography. The project includes MATLAB code for simulation, graphical visualization of 2D and 3D attractors, and the calculation of fractal dimensions.
